# guided-project

A cool project made by Payton Chertude:

- https://guidedprojects.dev/

Saw it as an opportunity to do some work where I'll get some feedback. Had a lot of fun participating in the project and learning some new tricks. Everything was really well organized and documented, and I'm looking forward to see what Payton does next.
